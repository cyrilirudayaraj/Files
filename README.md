   Objective: The main aim of this tool is to analyze the active 5g Band customers network quality and connectivity issues.
   Summary:
 FWA is a statistical tool that works on single or multiple market levels to culminate the impacted sites, CPE, sectors based on various factors like Delphi error code, change in frequency etc.
The result of SITE analysis shows the representation and details of affected site and its associated CPE and sectors on the map whereas the CPE analysis provides details about the 4g/5g anchor and main sites.
The tool ensure data quality of active 5g FWA Band Customers by testing the following parameters    
	    Heartbeat analysis	       
	    Alert analysis	       
                      Prediction vs Delhi result precision.


We have involved in the design discussion and planning of the application.
We have developed the Site->CPE and CPE->Site flow in angular .
Created production ready and reusable components, utilities and templates that can run across different JS frameworks.
Works on migrating the application from angular to react framework by pipelining the reusable utilities and components that are created in core technologies.
